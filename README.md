Raisin Picker
=============

Raisin Picker -  a personal knowledge management tool based on Drupal  

Go to [raisin-picker.com](http://raisin-picker.com/ "Raisin Picker") for more details on the project.

Status
------
Raisin Picker is in alpha status. Currently, most code is scattered in contributed modules, themes and patches. I try to create a Drupal distribution to make it easy to install it in one step.


Demo accounts
-------------
Since only parts of Raisin Picker is available as source code, I created a demo site with sample content to give you an impression how the tool can be used.
